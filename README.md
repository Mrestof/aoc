# Mrestof's Advent of Code solutions

## Requirements

> This repo may be multilingual in the future, but for now it's only `Python`,
> so the instructions are only for it

In case you want to run some of the solutions by yourself:

- You must have `Python` of the version 3.10 or higher.
- You need to install all the dependency packages. You can find them in the
  `meta/python/requirements.txt` file.
- You need to specify your key for the Python's `aocd` library,
  for details check their [docs](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data#quickstart).
